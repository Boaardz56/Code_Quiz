# Code_Quiz

## Description

A quiz with a timer was made by primarily coding though Javascript. The goal was to have a starting page that would direct you into the quiz and initiate the timer. The timer counts down and deducts 5 seconds if the user chooses the wrong answer. Once the user completes the quiz, the timer will stop and give a total score that the user answered correctly. 

In order to format how the quiz looks, CSS was used and linked to the HTML page to create a nicer presentation. As mentioned, the main functions of the quiz were done in Javascript. After all the question variables were entered, we linked the question answers to buttons for the user to click on. With use of the eventAddListeners, clicking on each button would then go onto perform another function, whether it was to move on to the next question or deduct seconds off the timer, until the game is complete.
